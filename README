MyPlace is a software developed by Arnaud Delcasse <delcasse@gmail.com>

This software is licenced under the terms of the MIT licence, located in
the file MIT-LICENCE.txt

This project uses Rails Framework and includes JQuery Javascript framework
and FullCalendar.js by Adam Shaw.

The full Ruby Gems list used within the project can be found in the Gemfile. Myplace
uses MongoDB NoSQL database and several Gems like :
 - MongoId : Rails ORM for MongoDB
 - Devise : Authentication plugin for Rails
 - ... (check Gemfile for more informations)

The project is still in an early development stage and cannot be used as production
software yet (there might be probably security issues and bugs).
Any help would be welcome and don't hesitate to fork this code on Github and provide
pull requests or feedbacks.

TODO (Quick overview, will be improved later with a roadmap) :
 - Finish calendar application
 - RSS reader
 - Webmail
 - Social feeds - Facebook/Twitter gateways, OStatus / Diaspora* protocols integration
 - Media integration (images, documents, videos, ...)
